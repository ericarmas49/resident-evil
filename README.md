The Resident Evil Campaign was a nationally recognized success.  Branded as “Must See Campaigns of 2017” and “Most Innovative”, the campaign received over 1 million views through all devices.  The opening shot of the hero consisted of 8 parallax layers of buildings, fire, wind and burning ash in addition to the title treatment and hero.  The user is fully immersed in the Resident Evil world with 3 videos, an editorial piece, a movie timeline, as well as an interactive section that shows pasts films and trailers.  Sony (client) gave us the creative freedom to create the experience.
